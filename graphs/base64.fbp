StdIn(stream/stdin)
StdOut(stream/stdout)
Gzip(stream/gzip)
OnData(stream/onData)
ReadStream(fs/createReadStream)
OnData(stream/onData)
OnEnd(stream/onEnd)
Append(string/append)

# Ok, this works as an example, but does not support sending multiple files.
# That autogrouping would be nice now, new onData just hmm
# how to know when onData is finished? onEnd maybe... :p duh.
# or hm, maybe it does ? No the stream will get overwritten.
'./graphs/base64.png' -> file ReadStream stream -> ^stream OnData out -> in StdOut

# will fail, will delete the other stream
#'./graphs/base64.png' -> file ReadStream

'Done' -> @msg Done(console/log)

ReadStream stream -> ^stream OnEnd
OnEnd :complete -> :start Done
# onEnd out
