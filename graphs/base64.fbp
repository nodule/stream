# Ok, this works as an example, but does not support sending multiple files.
# That autogrouping would be nice now, new onData just hmm
# how to know when onData is finished? onEnd maybe... :p duh.
# or hm, maybe it does ? No the stream will get overwritten.
'./graphs/base64.png' -> file ReadStream stream -> ^stream B64E stream -> ^stream OnData out -> in StdOut

# will fail, will delete the other stream
#'./graphs/base64.png' -> file ReadStream

'Done' -> @msg Done(console/log)

ReadStream stream -> ^stream OnEnd
OnEnd :complete -  >  :start Done
# onEnd out
